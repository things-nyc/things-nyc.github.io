- Title: Outreach and Gateway Deployment
  Lead: terrymoore
  Type: Organization
  Description: |
    The fundamental purpose of the organization is to promote and support deployment of gateways throughout New York City.
    To that end, group members take every opportunity to spread the word about
    The Things Network and the benefits of joining an open IoT network.

    Outreach includes participating in hackathon and workshop events, presenting in various technology fora,
    and meeting with commercial, non-profit, and government organizations that might benefit from using
    TTN. In addition, the group will recommend hardware and offer direct on-site support to people who want
    to deploy a gateway.
  Status: Ongoing
  Nextsteps:
    - More in-person hands-on make-it-work workshops.
    - Deploy fixed rooftop gateway with large antenna in commercial building.
    - Find foundation or commercial sponsor to kickstart gateway deployment.


- Title: Gateway fleet management system
  Lead: jeffhonig
  Contributors: terrymoore
  Type: System
  Description: |
    A system supporting the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of a fleet of Multitech
    Conduit and Conduit AP gateways.  As part of deploying hundreds of gateways to cover
    NYC and Ithaca regions of New York State, the group plans to offer management of those
    gateways as a service to gateway owners.  The system uses the Ansible Configuration
    Management tool to drive gateway configuration, an SSH jumphost to enable secure remote
    access and a monitoring tool to send alerts on gateway status changes.
  Status: Active Development, being used to deploy gateways
  Nextsteps:
    - Improve robustness
    - Continuous integration testing

  Type: Organization
  Description: |
    TTN-NY as an organization needs legal structure, accounting, and governance.
    It also needs to be present on the Web and social media in order to be found by people looking for
    LoraWAN support in NYC. We just recently produced a T-Shirt design and stickers!
  Status: Ongoing
  Nextsteps:
    - Complete 501(c)3 certification.
    - Add more project documentation on the website.
    - Enable donations by engaging a fiscal sponsor.
    - Meeting minutes and newsletter on website.

- Title: Arduino LMiC Library Forks
  Lead: terrymoore
  Contributors: frankleonrose
  Type: Library
  Description: |
    The LMiC (LoRa-Mac in C) library came from IBM and is hosted here:
    [https://github.com/matthijskooijman/arduino-lmic](https://github.com/matthijskooijman/arduino-lmic).
    When the team at TTN-NY first started building Arduino nodes, they discovered many missing features related to
    operating within the US band plan. Frank made an effort to submit merge requests back upstream but Matthijs has
    been slow to respond. Recent changes have not been converted to PRs. Terry forked the things-nyc repo and made
    even more extensive changes to support his Catena boards, including adding all global band plans. His repo
    is now our recommended LMiC library.
  Status: Deprecated. The MCCI-Catena fork is our recommended building block for Arduino development with the 1276/8 chips (RFM-95).
  Nextsteps: Document superiority of MCCI-Catena fork so that people use it first

  Type: Device
  Description: |
    The Manhattan Borough President, Gale Brewer, is a vocal advocate for building Smart City infrastructure
    in an open way that encourages innovation. TTN-NY is building LoRa node with GPS that will be installed
    in Gale’s primary vehicle. The Manhattan Borough President will thereby be actively participating in the
    development of a TTN coverage map as she conducts her business around the city.
  Status: Field Testing
  Nextsteps:
    - Write up build log
    - Install in MBP’s car

  Type: Device
  Description: |
    As part of the Harlem Heat Project, Brian has deployed a number of off-the-shelf sensors to measure indoor
    temperatures in the city. He would like to collect data from the sensors via TTN. However, he would like
    to avoid having to visit the sensors to replace batteries every two weeks.

    Terry provided Brian with a set of [Catena](https://github.com/mcci-catena/HW-Designs)-based sensors as
    a first stage of the project. They work well communicating with a gateway high on the CUNY campus, but they
    still consume power at a higher rate than Brian would like.

    Frank and Forrest figured out the protocol for communicating with existing long-running off-the-shelf
    temperature sensors. Now Frank is putting together a communications board that will be able to transmit
    readings via LoRa while conserving power by going into deep sleep while inactive.
  Status: Prototyping power management
  Nextsteps:
    - Deploy and test battery longevity


- Title: ISeeChange remote measurements

  Type: Device
  Description: |
    ISeeChange uses off-the-shelf high quality environmental sensors. The sensor manufacturer offers a
    cellular-based remote logging solution, but it is expensive.

    TTN-NY offered to build a LoRa based communications board for the sensor in order to test whether
    such a system would work for ISeeChange. In contrast to the HarlemHeat project, ISeeChange uses the next
    generation of sensor which has replaced serial communication with a USB-wrapped-serial system.
    The main challenge of this project is to build a low power board that acts as a USB host and then fit
    the entire communications board into the new enclosure.
  Status: Prototyping
  Nextsteps:
    - Build USB host that talks to USB serial sensor board.
    - Print custom board that fits in small enclosure

    - App
  Description: |
    TTN Mapper [https://ttnmapper.org/](https://ttnmapper.org/) is the standard mapping service used by more than 1500 TTN users globally.
    It contains more than 3 million transmission data points.

    Frank created the MapTheThings [https://map.thethings.nyc](https://map.thethings.nyc) service as a fully open source alternative
    with scalability as a primary goal. The service summarizes successful and attempted
    transmissions into a multi-scale geo-hashed grid so that displaying data for any region on the globe
    requires a (roughly) constant and relatively small volume of data downloaded. The server is deployed
    on Heroku with SQS buffering and summary data is served directly from S3.

    On the node side,
    MapTheThings pairs a bluetooth and LoRa enabled node with an iOS app that tracks location and
    drives transmission of packets. A GPS-equipped LoRa node can also send location packets, but in
    this use case there is no tracking of attempted transmissions.
  Status: Operational.
  Nextsteps:
    - Do more LoRa walking.
    - Data re-processing tools.
    - Improve scalability (Lambda + merging infrastructure like Kinesis or MR).
    - Data slicing features.
