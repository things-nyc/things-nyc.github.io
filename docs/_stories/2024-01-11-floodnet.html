<p>It's now becoming obvious that the 5G Internet of Things
promised by telcos a few years ago was nothing more than a way to
sell a new generation of smartphones. For several reasons, not
least being the cost involved, no IoT system widely distributed in
the field can be based on devices with the power and maintenance
requirements of 5G transmission.</p>

<!-- excerpt-end -->

<p>The real future of IoT lies at the other end of the power/cost
range in networks of cheap, low-power, long-range sensors based on
a technology that overcomes signal interference among a large
number of transmitters in close proximity and allows seamless
provision and maintenance of the gateways used to provide backhaul
to the internet or to local data processing systems.</p>

<p>New York City's FloodNet project is an early example of
real-world IoT in action. To meet the increasing challenge of
urban flooding, NYC has put in place a network of sensors in
flood-prone areas of the city to collect data on the presence,
depth, and duration of street-level flood events.</p>

<p>The 81 sensors so far installed by the project communicate
through a network of 17 gateways distributed across the five
boroughs. They have already recorded flooding caused by high
tides, stormwater runoff, storm surge, and extreme
precipitation. The data is publicly visible and available in a
form that can be used by multiple agencies for flood resiliency
planning and emergency response.</p>

<p>The FloodNet project is an excellent example of appropriate
technology. Existing water level sensors, such as those used by
USGS stream gauges, are far too bulky and expensive to be deployed
at scale across urban areas. The city needed cheap, accurate,
weatherproof, real-time flood sensors designed for long-term
unattended deployment independent of existing power and network
infrastructure, adaptable to many use cases, and featuring a
simple, open-source design.</p>

<p>The solution: solar-powered, pole-mounted ultrasonic
rangefinder modules assembled from off-the-shelf components at a
cost of less than USD200 apiece. (Members of The Things Network NY
assisted in the design of these devices. Plans are available from
FloodNet's Github page.)</p>

<p>The techologies that made this possible: <a
href="https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan/">LoRaWAN</a> and <a
href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/">The Things
Network.</a></p>

<p>Once a minute, a radio unit in each sensor module sends a
single item of encrypted data to the network of gateways (any
gateway can handle any remote sensor as long as the sensor is
located, in this densely built environment, within about 2 km of
the gateway). Data from the gateways is forwarded through The
Things Network to project servers hosted by New York University,
from which the data is <a
href="https://dataviz.floodnet.nyc/">made public</a> over the
internet using a variety of open-source tools such as Docker and
Grafana.</p>

<p>FloodNet's plans for the future include expansion of the
network to provide finer-grained coverage of the five boroughs and
an iteration of sensor design to improve performance and lower the
cost even further through manufacturing at scale.</p>

<p>Projects such as FloodNet show how the "smart city" concept can
become a practical reality through the adoption of appropriate
technologies. For a complete account of FloodNet, including
insights relevant to similar efforts, see <a
