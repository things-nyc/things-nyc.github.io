    - question: >-
        What is The Things Network and how is it different from
        LoRaWAN and LoRa?
      answer: >-
        The Things Network (TTN) is a free data network for the
        Internet of Things.  LoRa is an innovative way of using
        unlicensed radio spectrum to transmit small amounts of data,
        at long range with minimal power.  The Things Network uses a
        standardized protocol called LoRaWAN which uses LoRa
        technology to connect many devices to the Internet.
    - question: What is the difference between a node and a gateway?
      answer: >-
        Nodes are usually small, battery-powered sensors that upload
        their data to the Internet via The Things Network.  Gateways
        are strategically-placed access points that provide coverage
        for The Things Network.
    - question: >-
        What is the difference between network operators, application
        providers, and application users?
      answer: >-
        Network operators are the many community members (both
        corporate and individual) who own and operate the
        infrastructure behind The Things Network. Application
        providers provide services based on data and analytics from
        nodes they control. The application users benefit from the
        data from applications.
    - question: >-
        Does The Things Network New York provide a Service Level
        Agreement (SLA)?
      answer: >-
        No, but application providers may.

        Let's take an example. Suppose a company called "TrashAware"
        provides a garbage can monitoring service to U.S. cities. The
        city of "Smallville" is interested in TrashAware's product but
        requires an SLA stipulating 99.9% uptime. TrashAware assesses
        the current network coverage in Smallville, and then partners
        with the city to deploy additional gateways to ensure complete
        coverage and reliable service. TrashAware then issues an SLA
        to Smallville covering their entire application, which
        includes availability of data via their website and a mobile
        application.

  questions:
    - question: >-
        As a gateway operator, does installing the gateway make my own
        network vulnerable?
      answer: >-
        Technically yes, but the security risk is less than a
        smartphone connecting to your network's WiFi.

        A gateway _does_ technically represent an additional
        access point into a LAN and should not be placed inside of
        a trusted zone, however it is an order of magnitude less
        risk than a smartphone or employee PC. The gateways use
        industry-standard access control and are secured with
        administrative credentials setup during
        installation. While vulnerabilities via the packet
        forwarding protocol or the LoRa interface are conceivable,
        they are highly unlikely in practice. A LAN operator can
        mitigate the risk of compromised gateways on their network
        by placing them in a separate segment (VLAN), as is
        routinely done in corporate networks.
    - question: As an application provider or user, is my data private?
      answer: >-
        Data is encrypted from the node to the application: The
        Things Network does not have access to the decrypted data.

        It is the application provider's responsibility to ensure
        that their nodes are designed to adequately protect data
        prior to transmission. LoRaWAN has AES128 encryption by
        default, which should be sufficient for most uses, and
        additional encryption and security measures can be applied
        for applications which require them.

        The greatest threat to privacy is not in The Things
        Network itself, but rather in the third-party applications
        where the data is stored. TTN has no control over the
        security of data after it has been sent to and decrypted
        by applications. A bad actor could theoretically break
        into the application server and steal/delete/manipulate
        data or send control commands to IoT devices. Thus,
        application providers must take security precautions to
        ensure users can trust them with their data. This is a
        challenge for IoT in general and not specific to TTN.

        At the end of the day, if you are using any wireless tech
        whatsoever, you are transmitting in spectrum that is
        easily monitored by the public, so you must secure the
        data at the transmitter and not trust the network like we
        could(?) with landline telephone. That said, of course we
        should encourage good security/privacy practices
        throughout the network.
    - question: >-
        As an operator of a gateway, am I responsible for user's
        privacy?
      answer: >-
        No. The gateways simply listen for radio signals from
        nodes and pass encrypted data to the network. Gateways do
        not contain decryption keys or any privileged information
        about users.
